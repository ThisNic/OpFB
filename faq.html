<p><em>Notice</em>: This is an open development project. If you would like to submit code simply fork the repo, add your code, and initiate a pull request. </p>

<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Ideas?</strong> See the issue tracker tab in GitHub for this repo or join #OpFb  </p>

<p><strong>What purpose does this serve? </strong>
This tool will help to highlight potential targets that are more secretive in what they openly post. It will create a hierarchy of targets as well giving different value points to each based on a set of criteria.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>What needs doing? </strong>
Take a look at the issue tracker and see what kinds of work is needed. Feature requests, bugs, and other things will be listed there along with new ideas / concepts.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How do I get involved?</strong>
Fork the repo, write your code, and issue a pull request. Make sure to be as verbose as you can when explaining what it is your code does and how it benefits the project. Make sure to reference ticket numbers if the code you are submitting is related to a bug report or feature request.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How do I test my code?</strong>
Define your own "constants". Do not run your test code against real targets. I would suggest using something such as a company, product, or sports team to run tests again to see how many people you can find who are related to those things.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Is it necessary to make a facebook app to run this? </strong>
Yes. You can not access the Facebook Graph API without one and one will not be supplied for you. We do this so that each person's own private app ID's and keys are safe with them and are never shared. <strong>MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS REMOVE YOUR OWN FB APP SECRET CODE AND KEY BEFORE COMMITTING ANY CODE!!!</strong></p>
